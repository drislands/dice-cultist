# dice-cultist
Dice cultist! Right now, a new implementation of my game BACKRONYMS. Now with
slash commands, SQLite files instead of MySQL servers, and more!
<hr>
<p>To get started, first clone the git project:</p>
<code>git clone https://www.github.com/drislands/dice-cultist.git</code>
<p>Next, <code>cd</code> into the directory, and set up the virtual environment
with <code>python3 -m venv env</code>.</p>
<p>Now that you've got the virtual environment established, you'll need to
activate it. Do so by typing <code>source env/bin/activate</code>. You'll know
this has succeeded if the prompt in your terminal now is preceded with the text
<code>(env)</code>.</p>
<p>Once you've activated the virtual environment, install the requirements by
running <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>And now, at long last, you are ready to run the server! Making sure you're
still in the activated virtual environment, run <code>python main.py</code>. If
all goes well, you now have the server listening on port 5000!</p>
